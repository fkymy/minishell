<andor> ::= <pipeline>
        |  <andor> "&&" <pipeline>
        |  <andor> "||" <pipeline>

<pipeline> ::=  <command>
        |  <pipeline> "|" <command>

<command>  ::=  <word>
        |  <redirection_list>
        |  <command> <word>
        |  <command> <redirection_list>

<redirection_list> ::= <io_redirection>
        |  <redirection_list> <io_redirection>

<io_redirection> ::= <redirection_op> <filename>

<redirection_op> ::= "<" | ">" | ">>"
